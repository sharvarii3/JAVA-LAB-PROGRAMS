------CALCULATOR PROGRAM-------

This repository contains a simple and interactive menu driven Java-based calculator program. The application allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, calculate Fibonacci series, and perform array operations such as finding the mean and mode. It uses a modular structure for easy maintenance and extensibility.



PROGRAM STRUCTURE:

The program is divided into three main components:

1. Input Class

Handles all user input, including:

Reading two numbers for arithmetic operations.

Reading a single number for the Fibonacci series.

Reading an array for mean and mode calculations.

2. Calculator Class

Contains methods for:

Arithmetic operations: calculateSum, calculateDiff, calculateMul, calculateDiv

Generating Fibonacci series: FibonacciSeries

Calculating mean: calculateMean

Calculating mode using nested loops: calculateMode

3. Main Class

Displays a menu for users to choose operations.

Calls appropriate methods from the Calculator class based on user choice.
